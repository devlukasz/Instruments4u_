This is a project that I have developed for my final year project at University of the West of England. Instruments4u is an e-commerce store which displays scraped instruments data from several online instruments store for the purpose of finding a certain instrument for the best price available.

Currently the project is not fully developed! The project is planned to expand on the types of instruments that are scraped, as well as allowing accessibility on other devices such as mobile phones, tablets, etc.
